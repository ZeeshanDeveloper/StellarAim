                    <p>Mr.MuizUd Din Farid, the founder and Board Member at <span>Steller A.I.M</span> has a propensity
                        to
                        push for purity and precision. Multi-talented and distinguished for his entrepreneurial
                        ventures, he is equally as ambitious when spearheading projects as he is driven to
                        delivering a novel experience to his clients.</p>
                    <p>Hailing from the culturally rich city of Lahore, he received his general education at Aitchison
                        College Pakistan. He has also completed his BSC (Hons) in Applied Accounting from
                        Oxford Brookes University, further enriching his knowledge with an ACCA qualification from
                        Kaplan London UK.</p>
                    <p>With a penchant for multitasking, he is successively heading multiple ventures, which aptly
                        reflect his passion for the culinary arts, hospitality, technology and construction. Credited
                        with the conception of Baranh, Pakistan’s original heritage-revival concept-based restaurant
                        as well as pioneering online construction portal called Construcit, he has amassed a
                        building pool of growing brands.</p>

                        construction business Mark-Inn, the brand’s prominence has only soared.</p>
                    <p>His natural flair for real estate, familiarity with heading property development projects and
                        an inclination towards the finer things in life naturally progressed into the birth
                        of <span>STELLAR
